# Lab: Getting Stylish

## Overview

React/NextJS web applications handle things differently than web apps of the past. But that doesan't mean they still can't look good.

It's time to add some style to our components.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

Modify your existing NextJS client app to style it with Sass.

The style you add can be "hand rolled" without the use of additional styling libraries. But you can also leverage other tools if you like. 

Go live.

## Implementation Notes

- You won't be graded on how "good" it looks, but on your use of Sass thoughout the app.
  - In other words, you want to add color to your app, the exact colors you choose is up to you.
  - But do your best to have it look good.

### User Acceptance Tests

No automated tests. But application must be deployed.

## Configuration

- Option 1: Modify most recent NextJS lab to add style.
- Option 2: Create NextJS app from scratch.
- Deploy app to Vercel (or the host of your choosing.)
