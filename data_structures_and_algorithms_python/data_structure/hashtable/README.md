# Hashtables


## Challenge
### Features
## Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

* add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
* find: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
* Get_hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big o is o(1) and the worst case is o(n)

## White board:
