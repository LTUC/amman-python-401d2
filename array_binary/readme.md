# array_binary_search

we have a sorted array and a value

## Challenge

Write a function  which takes in an array and the value to search for it. return the index of the value if it not exist return -1

## Approach & Efficiency

check if the value equal the middle item in the array if not devide the array into two arrays and check again in the first part of the array if it the value that you enter to search for less than the higher value in the first part of the array if it's not serach in the secound part of the array if it's not exist too return -1 (not in the array)
