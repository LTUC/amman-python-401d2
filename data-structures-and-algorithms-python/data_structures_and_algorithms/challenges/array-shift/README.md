***Array Shift***

*This program takes an array and a number from user , then inserts the number at th center of new array.so you had stored list and number .*

***Challenge***
*Inserting the number at the center without using built in functions.so We go through the array and compare each value with required number.*

***Approach & Efficiency***
*To reach the middle of the array, we compare the given number with the valyes inside the array. Then we insert the number, and break outside the loop.*

***Solution***
