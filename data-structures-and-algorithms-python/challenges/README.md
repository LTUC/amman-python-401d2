## 3-First-in, First out Animal Shelter.
## Feature Tasks
* Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
* Implement the following methods:
1- enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
2- dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## 4-Multi-bracket Validation.
* function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean * representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

1. Round Brackets : ()
2. Square Brackets : []
3. Curly Brackets : {}
